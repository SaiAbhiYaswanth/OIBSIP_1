Iris Flower Classification Project

This project focuses on classifying Iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — using four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
Key Steps:
Data Loading & Cleaning: Loaded from a CSV file, checked for missing values and duplicates, and label-encoded the target variable.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Used pairplots, boxplots, and heatmaps to visualize feature relationships and detect patterns.
Model Training: Implemented a Random Forest Classifier, with comparisons to SVM and KNN.
Evaluation: Assessed models using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Outcome:
The Random Forest model achieved high accuracy. Petal features were the most influential for classification. This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

Applications:
Botanical Research: Automated identification of flower species based on morphological features.
Educational Tools: Demonstrating classification techniques and ML workflows using a simple, well-structured dataset.
AI Training: Serves as a beginner-friendly project for learning supervised machine learning and model evaluation.
Agriculture: Assisting in plant species classification and trait-based categorization for breeding and cultivation.
